Roleplaying Equipment abstract factory pattern
==============================================

An implementation of the abstract factory pattern as applied to equiping characters in a role playing game.  Each type of character gear
is given an abstrect product interface, these are implemented in concrete product classes.  The EquipmentFactory interfaceis implemented
in two concrete factory classes.  These concrete factory classes implement methods that return specific concrete products.  The Character
interface is implemented and gives rise to several concrete character client classes.  These classes take the the concrete factory
products and return the appropriate gear as generated by their factories.  This is basic practice with the abstract factory pattern.
